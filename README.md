## 🧪 Local Development

### 🧰 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker + Docker Compose
- AWS S3 bucket + IAM user with credentials
- PostgreSQL database

### 🏁 Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-dossier.git
cd digital-dossier

# 2. Create your .env file from the example
cp .env.example .env
# Set your AWS, DB, and app config values

# 3. Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# App runs at http://localhost:3003
````

### 🔄 Prisma Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Apply schema to DB
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

---

## 🔒 Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains keys like:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyy
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

* **Prisma KnownRequestError**: Usually means missing DB fields or schema drift — check `prisma.schema` and rerun migrations.
* **Missing uploads in S3**: Make sure `coverKey` and `pdfKey` are saved correctly in metadata.

---

## 📌 Planned Enhancements

* ✏️ Local Writing Mode for Blogs (in addition to uploads)
* 🎨 Full Canva-based template creation workflow
* 🔔 Real-time notifications for new uploads
* 📬 Email newsletter and community features
